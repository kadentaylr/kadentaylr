Hi my name is Kaden Taylor
I'm a young machine learning engineer specializing in creating advanced data analytics models
I've worked with Python, R, SQl and have some experience with Julia
I've just finished studying Data Analytics at Google and I'm looking to start creating a more diverse portfolio
I have an extreme passion for deep learning models and hope to get more experience working with them
